# Reflection on Version Control Using GitHub

## **Introduction**
This assignment involved learning GitHub for version control, collaborating with others, and handling tasks such as branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. This document reflects on my experience, challenges, and solutions.

## **Experience and Learning Outcomes**
Through this assignment, I gained hands-on experience with:
1. Creating and managing a Git repository
2. Working with branches for different features
3. Collaborating through pull requests and code reviews
4. Resolving merge conflicts effectively
5. Documenting the project using a README and GitHub Issues

## **Challenges Faced and Solutions**
### **1. Merge Conflicts**
- **Challenge:** I encountered a merge conflict when trying to merge `feature-2` into `main`.
- **Solution:** I manually resolved the conflict by editing `main.cpp`, committing the fix, and pushing the resolved version.

### **2. Understanding Pull Requests**
- **Challenge:** Initially, I was unsure how to create a proper pull request for review.
- **Solution:** I followed GitHubâ€™s official documentation and successfully assigned and merged PRs.

### **3. GitHub Issues and Documentation**
- **Challenge:** Writing clear and structured issues for tracking project tasks was new to me.
- **Solution:** I learned to create detailed issue descriptions and assign tasks effectively.

## **Final Thoughts**
Using GitHub for version control greatly improved my understanding of software collaboration. The hands-on experience with branches, pull requests, and conflict resolution provided insight into real-world development workflows.
